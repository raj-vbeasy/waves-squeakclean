Clean Studios, LLC (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) with its principal place of business at 8533 Washington Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 and (&ldquo;Licensor&rdquo;) effective as of (the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;) with respect to Licensor granting to Company certain rights in and to Licensor&rsquo;s catalog of musical compositions and sound recordings identified on Schedule A, which may be amended from time to time (collectively, the &ldquo;Tracks&rdquo;) for the purposes detailed below. For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rights Granted</span>: Licensor hereby grants to Company, throughout the world (the &ldquo;Territory&rdquo;) the following non-exclusive rights, during the Term (as such term is defined below): (a) to represent, pitch and directly enter into synchronization and other analogous agreements with third party users (&ldquo;Users&rdquo;) with respect to the Tracks, for any and all media now known or hereafter devised and for any period of time (including in perpetuity), including the right to edit loop, enhance, or modify the Tracks or to create instrumental only, sample free or clean version of the Tracks, provided that any such change shall not alter the fundamental character of the portion of the Track being used, and any such change shall not give rise to any ownership rights or claims, including copyright, on the part of Company and or User in or to the resultant sound recording, and to collect all consideration received in relation to the same; (b) to reproduce, display, adapt, transmit, communicate, perform, or otherwise use the Tracks solely in connection with the pitching, exploitation, advertising, marketing, and promotion of the Tracks in any and all media on a royalty free basis; and (c) to reproduce and use the names, approved likenesses, approved biographies of the writers and/or artists of the Tracks, and any visual elements connected to the Tracks (i.e.: album artwork, press photographs) (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and deemed granted if not granted or denied within three (3) business days of written request thereof), solely in connection with the uses and exploitations of the Tracks permitted hereunder, as well as in connection with the promotion of Company&rsquo;s business. Company shall have the right to authorize the synchronization of any Track in any commercial advertisement without Licensor&rsquo;s prior written consent in each instance, subject to the exclusions listed on Schedule B attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. All rights which are not expressly granted by Licensor to Company pursuant to this Agreement are specifically reserved by Licensor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Term</span>: This agreement may be terminated at any time with written notice of intent to terminate at sixty (60) days in advance (&ldquo;Termination Notice&rdquo;) pursuant to Paragraph 12 below. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Company must have the ability to retain all rights granted herein to Tracks that have already been pitched or licensed. All rights will be reverted to Licensor following the dismissal of the pitch or the conclusion of the license and all applicable options. Company shall use reasonable good faith efforts to remove the Tracks from Company&rsquo;s website within ten (10) business days of Company&rsquo;s effective receipt of the Termination Notice.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusivity</span>: Licensor is free to enter into agreements with other, non-exclusive, pitching services and music houses. Licensor agrees that it is hiring Company on an independent contractor basis, and that Company shall have the right to continue working with clients other than Licensor. Licensor hereby acknowledges that the business of placing music in media as contemplated herein is speculative, and no warranty is made by Company herein as to the number of licenses, if any, which may be secured during the Term or the profitability thereof.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audit</span>: Licensor shall keep accurate books of account and records covering all transactions relating to this Agreement and shall retain such documents in its possession or under its control relating to this Agreement, at its principal place of business for at least 2 (two) years following the commencement of the agreement. Said books of accounts and records shall be kept and maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and under a standard system customarily used in the music industry. The Licensor may at the Licensor&rsquo;s sole cost audit the books of account of Company as they directly relate to the Tracks on reasonable notice no more than once every twenty-four (24) months and no more than once in respect of any given statement. All statements shall be deemed accepted and binding if no notice of audit is received within one (1) year of the date of such statement. No proceedings may be brought against Company following the date one (1) year after the date of the relevant statement. Any agreed underpayment revealed by an audit will be credited to Licensor&rsquo;s account (or promptly paid to Licensor as relevant) and if such agreed underpayment is in excess of both ten percent (10%) of the monies that should have been paid and five thousand dollars ($5,000) then Company shall in addition reimburse the Licensor with the reasonable cost of the audit (excluding travel, accommodation and subsistence costs) subject to a maximum reimbursement of three thousand dollars ($3,000).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-Clearance</span>: All Tracks delivered by Licensor to Company (as defined on the Schedule A) must be &ldquo;pre-cleared&rdquo; in all media now known or hereafter devised, throughout the world, in perpetuity meaning that Licensor warrants and represents that Licensor has obtained written permission from all contributing parties in connection with the Tracks, including but not limited to the sound recording owners, musical composition owners, and any and all writers, authors, co-authors, publishers, record labels, performing artists, copyright owners, producers, and engineers.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miscellaneous</span>: This Agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties, superseding all prior agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties&rsquo; respective assigns, successors, heirs, and legal representatives. Neither party hereto shall be deemed to be the drafter of the Agreement, it being the parties&rsquo; mutual intention that this Agreement not be construed, in whole or in part, against either of the parties hereto. This Agreement cannot be modified, assigned, or amended, except by an instrument in writing signed by both parties hereto, except as otherwise provided for herein.

The waiver by either party hereto of a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement by the other party hereto shall not be construed as a waiver by the non-breaching party of any subsequent breach by the breaching party.

Neither party shall be deemed to be in breach of any of its obligations hereunder unless the non-breaching party shall give the breaching party specific written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the nature of the breach and the breaching party shall have failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after the breaching party&rsquo;s receipt of such written notice. All rights and remedies are cumulative and shall in no way affect any remedy available to either party under equity or law. Licensor&rsquo;s sole remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Company (or its licensees) shall be an action at law for damage, if any. In no event shall Licensor be entitled by reason of any breach to enjoin, restrain, or seek to enjoin or restrain the distribution or other exploitation of the Tracks. Nothing in the Agreement shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, partnership, joint venture, or other similar relationship between the parties, nor give any party the power or authority to act for or bind the other party in any manner unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that their relationship is one of independent contractors. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Fax and PDF copies of this agreement shall have the same force and effect as an original.</p>
